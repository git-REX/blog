Hi there! I'm Ananyo. Iâ€™m a Electrical and Electronic Engineering major turned programmer. """Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for my course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website] for more information on my other projects, as well as some of my writing."""
