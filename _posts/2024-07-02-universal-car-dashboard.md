## 🚗 Project Overview

The Universal Car Dashboard System is a multifunctional interface that unifies essential driving data into a streamlined digital format. This solution integrates seamlessly with various vehicle models using an adaptable hardware interface and custom-designed UI.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Camera Sensors for replacing vehicle side mirrors
- C++ & Visual Studios for data processing
- Custom UI with touchscreen support

---

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

Drivers often need to monitor various systems across multiple displays or analog dials. This dashboard centralizes critical information (fuel, battery, speed, temperature, etc.) into a user friendly touch-enabled interface**.
