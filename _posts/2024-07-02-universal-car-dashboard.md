## 🚗 Project Overview

The Universal Car Dashboard System is a multifunctional interface that unifies essential driving data into a streamlined digital format. This solution integrates seamlessly with various vehicle models using an adaptable hardware interface and custom-designed UI.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi 4
- CAN bus integration
- Python & MATLAB for data processing
- Custom UI with touchscreen support

---

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

Drivers often need to monitor various systems across multiple displays or analog dials. This dashboard centralizes critical information (fuel, battery, temperature, etc.) into a **single touch-enabled interface**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Real-time vehicle data visualization  
- CAN bus decoding and signal mapping  
- Modular widget layout for different car types  
- Bluetooth & Wi-Fi connectivity  
- Fail-safe backup system
